USITC Tariff Updates (${policyData.usitc.source}):

Identify and prioritize:
1. **Tariff surges** that could significantly impact costs (CRITICAL: the 19% steel tariff is a major threat)
2. **Policy changes** requiring immediate compliance updates
3. **Trade restrictions** affecting supply chain operations
4. **Documentation requirements** that could cause delays

For each threat, provide:
- Type: tariff_surge, policy_change, compliance_update, or trade_restriction
- Severity: high (immediate action required), medium (monitor closely), or low (informational)
- Clear, actionable title (e.g., "19% Steel Tariff Surge - Immediate Cost Impact")
- Detailed description with specific numbers and dates
- Source: exact organization name
- Business impact: quantify financial/operational effects
- Actionable recommendations: specific steps to mitigate
- Confidence level: 0-100 based on data quality
- Affected regions: specific countries/regions
- Estimated impact: dollar amounts or percentage changes

Prioritize threats by severity and business impact. Focus on actionable intelligence.`,
