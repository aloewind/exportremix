# Client-Managed API Keys

ExportRemix uses a **client-managed API key system** where each user configures their own API integrations through the dashboard. This approach ensures:

## Benefits

1. **No Configuration Prompts**: The app works immediately without requiring environment variables
2. **User Privacy**: Each user manages their own API credentials
3. **Flexibility**: Users can add any API they need
4. **Security**: API keys are stored encrypted per user, not shared globally
5. **Scalability**: No rate limit sharing between users

## How It Works

### For End Users

1. **Sign up** for ExportRemix
2. **Navigate** to Custom API Integrations in the dashboard
3. **Add** your own API credentials (name, endpoint, key)
4. **Enable** the integrations you want to use
5. **Enjoy** real-time data from your configured APIs

### For Developers

- **No environment variables** needed for API keys
- **No configuration prompts** in the build process
- **Fallback data** ensures the app works without any APIs configured
- **Supabase table** `user_api_integrations` stores user credentials securely

## Fallback Strategy

If no APIs are configured or API calls fail:
- App uses **estimated fallback data**
- All features remain functional
- Clear disclaimers indicate data source

## Migration from Environment Variables

Previous versions used predefined environment variables like:
- ~~`WTO_API_KEY`~~ (removed)
- ~~`ITC_API_KEY`~~ (removed)
- ~~`CBP_API_KEY`~~ (removed)

These have been completely removed. All API management is now client-side through the Custom API Integrations feature.

## Deployment

When deploying to Vercel:
1. **No API key environment variables** needed
2. **No configuration prompts** will appear
3. **App works immediately** with fallback data
4. **Users configure** their own APIs after signup

This approach eliminates deployment friction and ensures a smooth user experience.
